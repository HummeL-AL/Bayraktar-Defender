# Operation "Steel Bird"
## Description
You are the operator of a combat drone, whose task is to protect the city from waves of advancing enemies. To do this, your machine has an arsenal of various weapons at its disposal. For the destruction of enemy units, a generous reward is expected, for which you can ask the command to improve your drone, equip it with new toys, or fortify the city. However, for victims among the civilian population, a reprimand is due, which involves the seizure of previously issued funds.
